### Reddit API App

A simple application that connects to the Reddit API and fetches posts for a particular subreddit.
The main goal of the application is to demonstrate use of redux in managing state in slightly more
complex scenarious where state is changed by virtue of asynchronous actions that may take some
time to resolve as communication is still handled over the network.
